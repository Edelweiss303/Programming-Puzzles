/* Kattis problem: secretmessage
 *
 * Topic: Other
 *
 * Level: Challenging
 * 
 * Brief problem description: 
 *
 *	The first line of input contains 2 integers N, M, where 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^10^6, and M ∈ S. 
 *  Print the exact decimal preresentation of NM, i.e. every digit, 
 *	without trailing zeroes; if the quotient is less than 1, print one leading zero (see sample input).
 *
 *
 * Solution Summary:
 *
 *	Take in the 2 integers N and M as strings and initialize a blank string R. Iterativaly add to R
 * 	from the digits of N with or without leading zeroes depending on the cases described below. 
 *
 * Used Resources:
 *
 *	  
 *
 * I hereby certify that I have produced the following solution myself
 * using only the resources listed above in accordance with the CMPUT
 * 403 collaboration policy.
