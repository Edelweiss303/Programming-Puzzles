/* UVa problem: 11330
 *
 * Topic: Combinatorics
 *
 * Level: Easy
 * 
 * Brief problem description: 
 *
 *	 As usual, the first line contains the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line starting
 *	 with total number of pairs of shoes n. The following 2n numbers describe the initial arrangement of
 * 	 shoes on the rack. Each shoe is labeled by a positive integer at most 10,000 where two shoes share the
 * 	 same label if and only if they are part of the same pair. Both the left and right shoes of a given pair
 * 	 will be present (remember that left and right shoes alternate). For each test case, output one line 
 * 	 containing a single number â€“ the minimum number of swaps needed to pair up all shoes.
 *	
 * 
 * Solution Summary:
 *	
 *	 Start by storing the left shoes as indexes that point to the right shoes. Find the first place where the 
 * 	 index does not match the shoe and set that shoe as the current shoe. We set a temp shoe to shoes[currentShoe]
 *	 and set shoes[currentShoe] to currentShoe. A count is then incremented and the new current shoe is set to temp. 
 * 	 This is continued until the list of all shoes is equal to their indices. The result is the sum of all the counts.
 *

 *
 * I hereby certify that I have produced the following solution myself
 * using only the resources listed above in accordance with the CMPUT
 * 403 collaboration policy.
