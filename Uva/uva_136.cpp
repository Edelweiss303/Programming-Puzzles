 /* UVa problem: 136

 * Topic: Data Structures
 *
 * Level: Challenging
 * 
 * Brief problem description: 
 *
 *   Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence
 *	 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, ...
 * 	 shows the first 11 ugly numbers. By convention, 1 is included.
 *   Write a program to find and print the 1500â€™th ugly number.
 *
 *
 * Solution Summary:
 *
 *   An ugly number is an example of a 5-Smooth number. These numbers can be created with a certain combination
 *   of multiples of 2, 3, 5. We can find the 1500th one by dynamically creating a vector with the first 1500
 *   ugly numbers. We do this by creating 3 pointer indexes that point to the next multiple of 2, 3, and 5 
 *   respectively. First we initilize a vector containing 1. We then choose the smallest of the 3 
 *   multiples as the next ugly number, in this case, 2. 2 is then added to the vector and the index for 
 *   2 is incremented and now the next lowest multiple would be 3. 3 is added to the vector and the 
 *   index for 3 is incremented. And so on and so on until the vector is filled with 1500 numbers. 
 *
 *
