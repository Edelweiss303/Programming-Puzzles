/* UVa problem: 713

 * Topic: Other
 *
 * Level: Challenging
 * 
 * Brief problem description: 
 *
 *	Reversed number is a number written in arabic numerals but the order of digits is reversed. The
 *	first digit becomes last and vice versa. For example, if the main hero had 1245 strawberries in the
 *	tragedy, he has 5421 of them now. Note that all the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the
 *	number ends with a zero, the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). Also note that the reversed
 *	number never has any trailing zeros.
 *	ACM needs to calculate with reversed numbers. Your task is to add two reversed numbers and
 *	output their reversed sum. Of course, the result is not unique because any particular number is a
 *	reversed form of several numbers (e.g. 21 could be 12, 120 or 1200 before reversing). Thus we must
 *	assume that no zeros were lost by reversing (e.g. assume that the original number was 12).
 *	The input consists of N cases. The first line of the input contains only positive integer N. Then follow
 *	the cases. Each case consists of exactly one line with two positive integers separated by space. These
 *	are the reversed numbers you are to add. Numbers will be at most 200 characters long.
 *	For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer â€” the reversed sum of two reversed
 *	numbers. Omit any leading zeros in the output.
 *
 * Solution Summary:
 *	
 *	Use Javas BigInteger library to compute the addition of large numbers.
