/* UVa problem: 107
 *
 * Topic: Arithmetic
 *
 * Level: Challenging
 * 
 * Brief problem description: 
 *
 *   The input consists of a sequence of cat-in-hat specifications. Each specification is a single line consisting
 *   of two positive integers, separated by white space. The first integer is the height of the initial cat, and
 *   the second integer is the number of worker cats.
 *   The number of cats inside each (non-smallest) catâ€™s hat is a constant, N. The height of these
 *   cats-in-a-hat is 1/(N+1) times the height of the cat whose hat they are in.
 *   The smallest cats are of height one.
 *   For each input line (cat-in-hat specification), print the number of cats that are not working, followed
 *   by a space, followed by the height of the stack of cats.
 *
 * Solution Summary:
 *	 The sum of all the cats can be represented by the series N^0 + N^1 + N^2 + ... + N^k.
 *	 The sum of heights can be represented by the serue N^0(initialHeight/(N+1)^0) + 
 *   N^1(initialHeight/(N+1)^1) + ... + N^k(initialHeight/(N+1)^k).
 *   It follows that the sum of the non-working cats is N^0 + N^1 + ... + N^(k-1).
 *   Since we know the height of the final cats is one, then initialHeight/(N+1)^k must equal 1.
 * 	 We can iterate through N and continually multiply (N+1) with itself until the result reaches the initialHeight.
 * 	 This method doesn't solve for two cases. The first where the input is 1 1. In this case, 0 1 is printed. The other
 * 	 case is when the number of workers is 1 but the initial height isn't. In this case, we know that the initial height
 *   is a power of 2 so we just iterate through powers of 2 until we reach the initial height. Here, N is always 1.
 * 	 The final step is to calculate the sum of the two series and print them.
