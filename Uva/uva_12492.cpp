/* UVa problem: 12492
 *
 * Topic: Combinatorics
 *
 * Level: Easy
 * 
 * Brief problem description: 
 *
 *	An interesting property of the Rubikâ€™s Cube is that any sequence of movements, if applied repeatedly,
 *  causes the cube to return to its original state (the state it had before the first application of the
 *  sequence). For example, after four applications of the sequence B the cube returns to its original state.
 *  You must write a program that, given a sequence of movements, determines the minimum number
 *  of complete applications of that sequence to make the cube return to its original state.
 *  The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line, which contains the
 *  sequence of movements. For each test case your program must print a single line, containing a single 
 *  integer, indicating the minimum number of complete applications of the given sequence to make the hub 
 *  return to its original state.
 * 
 * Solution Summary:
 *	
 *	We can represent the Rubik's cube using an array from 0 to 53, with each square on the cube represented 
 *	as shown at the bottom of the page. Using a function to rotate each face clockwise and counter clockise
 *	as well as a function to rotate the edge along each face clockwise and counter clockwise, we can simulate
 *	any sequence of moves. We simply repeat each move until the array return to 0 to 53 and count how many times
 *	the sequence was repeated.
 *
 * Used Resources:
 *
 *
 * I hereby certify that I have produced the following solution myself
 * using only the resources listed above in accordance with the CMPUT
 * 403 collaboration policy.
